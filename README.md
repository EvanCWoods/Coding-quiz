# bootcamp-week4-homework

This repository holds the code for the "University of Sydney Full Stack Flex Coding Bootcamp" Week 4 Homework. The web page is a coding quiz consisting of 5 multiple choice questions surrounding coding in javascript.

The questions are selected randomly out of a library of questions stored in an object 'questionsAndAnswers'. The code checks to the question library against the answered questions array to ensure that no queastions are re asked.

There is a 3 second time penalty applied for every wrong answer and the game ends when either there are no more questions left or the timer runs out (0 seconds).

High scores will be stored in local memory and area ccompanied by the players initials which can be viewed by clicking the "View High Score" button on the top left of the page.
